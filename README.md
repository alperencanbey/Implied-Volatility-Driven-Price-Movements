# Implied Volatility Driven Price Movements

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of changes in implied volatility on equity and stock index prices. Through detailed simulations, the study explores how delta hedging rebalances caused by implied volatility shifts exert pressure on underlying asset prices, a phenomenon distinct from traditional information-based market explanations.

Note: The article can be found in the repository. The simulation codes can be shared on demand.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **R:** For conducting simulations and statistical analysis.
  
## Methodology
- **Model Development:** Introduction of an implied volatility term into the price evolution process to study the feedback effect on underlying prices.
- **Simulations:** Conducted using Monte-Carlo methods to illustrate the effects of implied volatility changes, focusing on pinning probabilities and the behavior of asset prices under different volatility scenarios.

## Results and Impact
- **Findings:** Demonstrated how market positioning and implied volatility changes influence asset prices, potentially leading to price pinning or repulsion from strike prices.
- **Implications:** Provides insights into the mechanics of market microstructure and its short-term inefficiencies, contributing to the understanding of how derivative markets interact with underlying asset prices.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Challenges:** Developing a model that accurately captures the complex dynamics of implied volatility and its market effects.
- **Learnings:** Enhanced understanding of the quantitative relationships between options markets and underlying asset prices, particularly in the context of significant volatility events.
